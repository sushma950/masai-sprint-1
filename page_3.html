            <div><p>Popeye, a pugnacious, wisecracking cartoon sailor who possesses superhuman strength after ingesting an always-handy can of spinach.<br/> 
              Popeye is a scrappy little seaman with bulging forearms, a squinty eye, and a screwed-up face, punctuated with an ever-present pipe in his mouth. He is always ready for a fight instead of a reasonable discussion, has a gravelly voice, and is constantly mumbling under his breath. His credo is “I yam what I yam, and that’s all what I yam.” His girlfriend is the gangly, uncoordinated Olive Oyl, for whose attention Popeye vies constantly with Bluto, his bearded, hulking rival. Other recurring characters include J. Wellington Wimpy, a hamburger-loving coward; Swee’pea, Popeye’s adopted baby (whom he calls his “infink”).</p>
